# Snake-Game
Step into the past with our Python rendition of the classic Snake game. Maneuver a pixelated snake around the screen, gobbling up randomly placed food to grow longer. Control the snake's direction with arrow keys, avoiding walls and your own tail. The longer the snake, the more challenging it becomes to navigate. Relive the nostalgia of the original game while enjoying smooth controls and addictive gameplay. See how high you can score and challenge yourself to beat your best. Get ready for endless hours of retro-inspired fun!
